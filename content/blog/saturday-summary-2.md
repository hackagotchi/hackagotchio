## Introduction
Hello Hacksteaders! Welcome to the first Saturday Summary of July! Oh, and if you haven't already congratulated yourself on completing another year of school, feel free to do so now! You're one step closer to graduating.

Anyways, let's get on with the show!

**TL;DR**: Everyone's thrilled with the progress we're making, loads of new cool stuff is in the pipeline, and there's lots of things going on in the background.

## The Questions

This week's questions were:
1. How are you feeling about the project? Are there any goals that you're working towards?
2. What was your favourite bit of the development week, and why?
3. If you were a pizza delivery driver, how would you best benefit from a pair of scissors?
4. What features are you most excited to work on/implement in the future?

## The answers

### How are you feeling about the project?

There were loads of resoundingly positive messages about the project so far. We've received a *lot* of fantastic feedback from the community, and we're well on the way of our (hidden) goal of proving that Rust can be used in production, and scale efficiently!

Let's start off with our newest member: Owen! Collectively, we've moved from a monorepo approach to an interconnected stack. Owen spearheads that change by working on the core repository, which contains all the main structures and APIs that all other frontends rely on. They've been making excellent progress on that, and they're excited to see how it'll help the rest of the project grow!

In addition, Cedric's working on separating the Slack frontend from the backend, all but making sure that we have less code quality issues in the future. This move will also help the community work on webhooks and mods for the game! In the far future, we hope to make Hackagotchi a standalone game rather than one that's intrinsically dependent on another platform. On the side, he's enjoying tinker(spore?)ing around with the graphical client and 3d animations!

### Favourite bit of the development week

The development week was fairly short, with not too much going on. However, this isn't to say that there weren't some fan favourites!

Cedric really liked deleting some of the old code (relevant [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/844/)) from the early stages of the monolith Slack client, Owen went on vacation for a bit, and Eleeza loved designing some of the new 'Gotchi!

### If you were a pizza delivery driver, how would you best benefit from a pair of scissors?

This was our wildcard question for this week! I think this is an excellent trend to haveâ€“everyone really liked it, and I hope our hacksteaders do too!

Owen (who I strongly suspect to be a vampire) wanted to cut the pizza box in a way that would be easier to use as a plate (of course, this was after deleting their previous message about cutting up credit cards), and Eleeza wanted to cut out little stickers for the customers. Cedric did the most practical thing of all: stabbing through all the boxes to stabilize them (however, you'd need a very long pair for that. Maybe Orpheus could make them!)

### Features everyone's looking forward to making

As always, our backend expert (Owen) is really looking forward to the switch to a polyrepo approach. Eleeza's working on some stickers (!) and designing some of the newer Hackagotchi items (exciting!), and Cedric's looking forward to making the graphical client look as awesome and cute as possible! 

In his words: "I want cyl staffs to pulse beams of energy to the plants they're helping; I want orphei to meander around your hackstead in the most adorable and aimless way possible; I want people's hacksteads to be vibrant and pure."

## The Conclusion

Thank you for tuning in to this week's *Saturday Summary*, from the Hackagotchi Developer Team! We hope you're interested in the project just as much as we are, and we can't wait to see you hatch as many eggs as you can!

That's about it from us,

The Hackagotchi Dev Team.

P. S. There will be some pretty exciting changes to our community management coming up in the next week now that summer's finally started. Stay tuned! ~Ricey
