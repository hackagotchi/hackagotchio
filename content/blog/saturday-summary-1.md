## Introduction
Hello Hacksteaders! Welcome to the first-ever Saturday Summary, a compilation of all the things going on in the Hackagotchi developer world! We'll be featuring some of the interesting stack shifts, weird out-of-context messages, and the funny antics of [Cedric](https://github.com/cedric-h).

Each week, three questions are asked to the entire dev team, to understand what everyone's working on, and how their contributions are affecting the game as a whole. Let's get started!

## The Questions

This week, the three questions were:


1. 1. **What's the most interesting feature you've worked on this week/are looking forward to working on?**
2. 2. **What was the weirdest thing you saw in the dev channel or *[#hackstead](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C012J554P8T)?***
3. 3. **What skills are you working on?**

### What's everyone working on?

We had some really interesting answers across the board! Let's start off with Cedric. They're working on the graphical client for Hackagotchi along with Jacob and Richard (they're working on the art and config files for the entire project), and there have been some cool developments. One of the issues that they've been facing is displaying a hackstead in a non-cluttered way. Currently, the best way to do it is by using a hexagonal pattern (take a look at honeycombs! They're incredibly space-efficient), and Cedric's working on making it a little bit simpler. 



Jacob's also working on a lot of the newer potion mechanics for the next update, which is intended to refresh Hackagotchi in general! Richard's also working on the 'cake' (can't disclose too much about that just yet ðŸ˜‰) with Cedric!



And of course, we can't miss out on the newest dev member: Owen Salter (also known as muirrum)! They're working on the backend API for use in all the frontend clients across the board, from the Slack, to the standalone Web frontend, and even the downloadable Rust one!

### Interesting things

I'm afraid some bad news has come up in the developer team: Richard has an addiction. Yes, you heard that right. Our lovely artist has become addicted to potions! Not the usage of them, the creation! In fact, he storyboarded, drew, *and* animated an entire potion library from scratch in **just one day**! (If you ask me, I think substances other than potions were in play there)



Cedric and Jacob both had some odd experiences in the Slack Channels: "big daddy plant" and the lack of functionality from the phrase "@hackagotchi spawn 12 Chicken Nugget" were some fan favourites.

### Skills everyone's working on

Of course, the key to any developer team is continuous growth! Hackagotchi isn't just about growing out your Gotchi and plants, it's about everyone having fun! And for us, fun is learning new things.



Cedric's working on learning MongoDB for Rust, at the request of Owen, who wanted to use it for the backend. It's a little bit difficult understanding how indexing maps over, but he's getting through it!

Richard's been working on his art skills much more. More specifically, he's working on his character design, but also working on communicating with Cedric to help erase any ambiguity about design decisions.

## The Conclusion

Well, that's about it for this week's *Saturday Summary*! The next update for Hackagotchi is coming soon, and we're all super psyched to see what you think of it. The skills that we're starting to learn will help us help you in your quest to get those eggs, and the comedy is always nice.

Happy Hacking,

**The Hackagotchi Dev team.**
