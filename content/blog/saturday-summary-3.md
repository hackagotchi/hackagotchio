Welcome to this week's Saturday Summary! This week we're going to be talking
about changes to our deployment process and some changes to our ongoing backend
development.

## The Questions
The questions for this week were:

1. What have you done this week? Anything you're especially proud of?
2. What are you looking forward to in the week ahead?
3. What dessert would you be and why?

## The Answers
Cedric has been working on switching the backend development from MongoDB to
PostgreSQL after discussing the pros and cons of each. Nick has been reworking
our game configurations from JSON on Google Sheets to git-tracked YAML, and Owen
has been doing DevOps work to automate deployment of the slack bot.

In the week ahead, expect a new Code of Conduct to codify the unwritten rules
and provide a system of accountability. Ced will be creating a new client based
on the current backend implementation.

As for desserts, Luke and Owen would be ice cream from Kimball Farms in New
England. They call it "the best ice cream ever made". Ced would be revenge,
given that his code is delivered so late it's cold, and Eleeza would be a crepe.

## The Conclusion
Thanks for reading this week's Saturday Summary! Rishi couldn't write this week,
so I'm filling in for him.

Happy Hacksteading!
