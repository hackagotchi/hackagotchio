# Overview
With Hackagotchi, you can have a farm and cute adorable Orphei that earn you passive income in GP.

# Goal
Hackagotchi was built to revitalize the GP economy in [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) but has grown into much more than that.

# Land, Farming, and Resources
When you hackstead, you get a tile of land. You can buy more tiles of land later
after your hackstead has earned more XP. You plant things on your tiles of land
which yield resources at regular intervals. These resources aren't GP, imagine
things like "Hacker Spirit" and "Orange Energy Crystals." Your plants level up
after they've been growing for a while.
Higher level plants yield more resources and give your hackstead more XP so you
can buy more tiles of land. Plants get bonuses to their yield and rate of growth
if they're planted on tiles next to plants of the same type, this encourages
people to grow only one or two types of plants, meaning that they'll only get
one or two types of resources regularly.

# Fees and Hackagotchi
In order to craft useful things you need multiple types of resources, so you
have to buy and sell from other Hack Club members on the open market. You also
aren't given any seeds to start with, so you have to buy some seeds off of the
open market as well. There's a small 5% clerical fee when you put something up
for sale on the market, and there's also fees on hacksteading. All of this fee
money is later "found" by Hackagotchi during events called "Harvests." The
innocent Hackagotchi simply give that money to their owners.

# Hackagotchi and Items
You can craft items that give you a chance of spawning different types of
Hackagotchi. Hackagotchi give you more GP the happier they are. Hackagotchi can
hold items which make them happier. For example, if two Hackagotchi on your
hackstead are both holding "Friendship Bracelet" items, you get a small
happiness boost. If one Hackagotchi is holding a Rubiks cube, you have a small
chance to get a 10% boost to the happiness of your Hackstead when a harvest
occurs.
